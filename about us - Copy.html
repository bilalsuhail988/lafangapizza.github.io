    <h1>Karachi Pizza History</h1>
    <p>From humble beginnings as a single pizza restaurant in 2021, Karachi Pizza today has become the recognized world leader in pizza delivery. We have been dedicated to making and delivering great pizza with high quality ingredients from the start. In addition, we are constantly updating and improving our pizza menu.
        Beyond pioneering the concept of efficient delivery of made-to-order pizzas, we have been part of innovations that have made significant impact on the entire FOOD DELIVERY industry:
        Karachi' Pizza pioneered patented insulating pizza bags to keep pizzas oven-hot and crisp during normal delivery.
        Karachi's created the sturdy, corrugated pizza box, which keeps moisture from weakening the box and cheese from sticking to the top.
        Karachi's invented the 3-D car-top sign, which is currently used by a variety of industries, including taxis and driving schools.

        <h1>Beyond Pizza Delivery</h1>
        <p>Karachi launched online pizza ordering in 2007, and in 2008 revolutionized the online delivery experience by launching the innovative Pizza Builder and Domino's Tracker tools. Pizza Builder was a step forward in ordering food online , allowing customers to see their pizza come to life on the computer screen, while karachi piza Tracker was an innovation in food delivery , allowing customers to follow the progress of the order from the time it's placed until they receive it. We also added pizza coupons and promos to the website in order to provide even more value to our customers. Our innovations simply help us get better at what we love to do most: deliver great pizza to your door, efficiently and enthusiastically!
